# First App created for the brazillian company Gap√£o do Circo
company site: http://galpaodocirco.com.br/

My first program to help a real company.

OBS: When I created this app I did not know pandas module, so it uses CSV and lots of parsing logic to manage tables.

The goal of the app is to automate a monthly task of getting an raw table given by the school software and work the data to output a table discriminating values, types of incomes, discounts and other informations for comission pourpose.

The app also offers another table discriminating values for monthly administration.

*Implementation result: Although a simple program, it was very useful cause due to successfully relieve the administrator from his monthly task of manual parsing the data and even helped the company find mistakes in the way some registers was done in company's CRM.
